`llama3.np` is a pure NumPy implementation for Llama 3 model. For an accurate implementation, I ran the [stories15M model](https://github.com/karpathy/llama2.c?tab=readme-ov-file#models) trained by Andrej Karpathy. 

- For a detailed explanation in English, see [Llama 3 implemented in pure NumPy]([https://docs.likejazz.com/llama3.np/](https://thellm.substack.com/p/llama-3-implemented-in-pure-numpy)).
- If you're interested in CUDA implementation, see [Llama 3 implemented in pure C/CUDA](https://github.com/likejazz/llama3.cuda).

## Usage

```shell
$ python llama3.py "I have a dream"
"""
I have a dream. He dream of a big, beautiful garden full of flower and tree. He dream of playing with hi friend and eating yummy snack.
One day, he wa walking in the garden when he saw
